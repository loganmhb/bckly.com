title: Death to Categories
---

When I first set up this blog, long before I had any actual posts to speak of, I spent a while thinking about what kinds of categories I should organize my posts into. I planned to write about programming, and programming posts are pretty unlikely to be interesting to non-programmers, so I figured I should have a category for those - "code", call it. But I didn't *only* want to write about programming, I wanted to write about other things too -- important things even if they weren't always big, thoughts about living even if only day by day. Those things seemed like they might be more generally interesting than the "code" posts, so I figured maybe I should just lump everything into a separate category called "life". That seemed strange, though, because really programming is a part of life too, even if it does involve a peculiar form of insanity.
