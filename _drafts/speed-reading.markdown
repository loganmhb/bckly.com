title: Speed readers and premature optimization

Yesterday I noticed that my phone's Kindle app had a feature called "Word Runner." I'm a sucker for dictionaries and thesauruses and so forth, and hoping it was something like that I clicked on it. I was disappointed to find this:

I've seen several similar apps designed to increase your reading speed, but I hadn't tried one before, so I gave Word Runner a brief try. It was depressing - reading one word at a time was indeed faster, but felt detached or unmoored from the text, words unspooling quickly before my eyes but failing to accumulate any real context or meaning.

I was curious whether there had been research done on this -- do speed readers actually enable you to read more in the same amount of time, or do you sacrifice comprehension for speed?
