title: Trees, names

I found a Wikipedia gem today: [the Tree of Ténéré][article], once the world's most isolated tree, "so well known that it and the Arbre Perdu or 'Lost Tree' to the north are the only trees to be shown on a map at a scale of 1:4,000,000." How strange and delightful. It's on a [list of named trees][list], which I stumbled upon while looking for a guide to the common names of trees. It's been kicking around in the back of my head for a while that I'd like to learn more of the names of things. I once worked on a vegetable farm, but I still can't identify most of the plants I walk past on a regular basis. It feels like a layer of awareness that I am missing. I could learn to recognize plants without knowing what they are called, of course, but it seems much harder to operate in that direction. The name is a key to a part of the world.

That reminds me of a book I came across when I was younger, a guide to trees which allowed you to find out what a particular tree was via a choose-your-own-adventure mechanic -- are the veins in the leafs branching or parallel? How many lobes do the leaves have? How do the leaves cluster on the branches? Illustrations clarified each of the choices. I think I only used this book once, for a school project, so it must have made quite an impression. It was the novelty of the lookup mechanism, I think. I was accustomed to looking words up in a book to find their meanings, but looking up plants by their structure to find their names -- that was exciting.
