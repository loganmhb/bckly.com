title: Missing from minimalism
---

Minimalism is in the air. How long has that been going on, in the most recent pop-cultural trend? Since 2008 or so?

I don't know whether culture follows economics or economics follow culture, but when I read about minimalism I always feel that something is missing.

It presents itself as an anticonsumerist ideology, valuing meaningful living in place of mindless consumption. And buying fewer things is indeed good! I think most rich people would be happier if they bought fewer things. But at the same time minimalism is an ideology of privilege: you _choose_ not to buy useless shit, you _choose_ not to climb the corporate ladder for a six-figure job, even though those options are available to you. A minimalist identity is still defined by consumption, just in negative space. It places choice and the individual foremost above society and circumstances.

I see a lot in common between what minimalists value -- time to focus on the work that matters to them, time to spend with friends and family -- and what Marx called the "realm of freedom", the things that we can spend time on when all of our basic needs are taken care of. The gospel of minimalism says to the well-off, your needs are met. You can do what you want. This is true. But a society as wealthy as ours should be able to induct many more people into this fortunate company of people whose needs are met, and that's a structural problem, one that requires political solutions.
