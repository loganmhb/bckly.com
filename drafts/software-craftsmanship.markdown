What is it about software craftsmanship that bothers me?

"artisanal Go application"

James Hague - programming in the small

Programmers who call themselves software craftsmen are particularly likely to be consultants.

Craftsmanship: "the quality of design and work shown in something made by hand"

but software craftsmanship advocates typically focus on the _internals_ of the program. The software craftsmanship movement focuses on means over ends, on the beauty and function of the code itself rather than the beauty and function of the resulting program.

is the code not the program?
