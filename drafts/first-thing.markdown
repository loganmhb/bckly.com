Last year I decided to participate in National Novel Writing Month,
the goal of which is to write a 50,000 word first draft of a novel
during the course of a single month. That works out to around 1,700
words per day of fiction.

I decided to do this because for a couple of years now I've been
trying to spend more time writing, but I hadn't established a habit of
writing every day. When you have to write 1,700 words in a day,
there's no choice whether or not to write -- the prospect of being
behind 1,700 words is worse than the prospect of sitting down and
writing for an hour. Even if you don't make it to the target every
day, you're motivated to write at least some, to minimize the deficit.



I've been writing fiction for a while, on and off, but I've never
produced that much prose in that short a time before.
