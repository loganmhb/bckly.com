title: Too Many Books
---

I am perpetually reading too many books. Sometimes this makes me feel
anxious. _Wouldn't it be nice_, I think to myself, _to just read one
book straight through for once?_

Around New Year's this year I started keeping a list of books that I
was reading, noting the dates on which I'd started and, hopefully,
finished them. I didn't start that list with the intention of forcing
myself to finish books, but I found that the mere existence of it
pushed me towards picking up the book I was already in the middle of
rather than the seductive stranger discovered buried on my shelves or
on display in a bookstore.

As anywhere, there's a balance to be struck.

how to talk about books you haven't read

life is too short to finish books you don't like

It takes practice to sit down and read. I was better at it when I was
younger, before I had a smart phone and a laptop. But it's not
downhill from here. I've gotten better at it over the past two years,
I think. It's only a matter of resisting the momentary urge to put
down what you're reading and do something else. Perhaps it was not
always this way -- perhaps books were once the most immediately
stimulating things around for people of a certain class and lifestyle
-- but today reading a book is like meditating. It requires that you
sit with resistance, acknowledge distractions and then let them go.

Every once in a while a book will grab hold of you and you'll have no
thought but to finish it. That's something to treasure.
