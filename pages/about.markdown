Hello! I'm Logan. I'm a programmer by trade. I also enjoy writing, the board game Go, and growing vegetables (harder to do now that I live in New York).

I mostly write about programming here, but maybe I'll find some other interesting things to talk about.

Elsewhere on the internet, you can find me lurking on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@loganmhb), see my projects on [Github](https://github.com/loganmhb), or play a game of go with me on the [KGS Go Server](http://www.gokgs.com/) (I'm loganmhb there too). You can also reach me by [email](mailto:logan.buckley@gmail.com).
